## About me

Hi! My name is Kamil. At the begining of 2021 I had a brilliant idea. I started to learn programming. Now I'm looking for my first job as a Frontend Developer.

## About this project

This is one of my favourite classic game - Minesweeper.
I start this project few weeks ago and I am still working on it.
Right now it has only few basic features.

## How to play

To start game left click the field that You want to check or change difficulty level under the grid.
U can't hit mine in Your first move. A timer will start counting the seconds of your game.
If a number appears, it indicates the number of mines in the eight surrounding squares.
If a square is blank, there are no mines within the eight squares surrounding it.
Minesweeper is a game of deduction. If you guess where a mine is, right-click the square to place a flag on it marking it as a mine.
Right-click a square twice to place a question mark on it if you think it might contain a bomb but youâ€™re not sure.
If you click a square and a bomb appears the game is over and You lost. Reveal all squares without a mine to win a game.
All the hidden bombs are exposed if you hit a mine. Start a new game by clicking face over the grid, or change difficulty level under the grid.
