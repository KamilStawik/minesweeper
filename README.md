## About me

Hi! My name is Kamil. At the begining of 2021 I had a brilliant idea. I started to learn programming. Now I'm looking for my first job as a Frontend Developer.

## About this project

This is one of my favourite classic game - Minesweeper.
To run this project You need to allow emoji in Your browser.
I start this project few weeks ago and I am still working on it.
Right now it has only few basic features.
In the near future I will add question mark fields, best times board and much more :)

### version: 0.2.0
Now user won't pick mine field in first move. First field is always safe and surrounded by safe fields (like in classic minesweeper game).

### version: 0.3.0
Now user can mark field as question by double right click.

### version: 0.4.0
Now if field is marked as flag it can't be clicked.
Some performance upgrade.
